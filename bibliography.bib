  abstract = {Converting a noisy parallax measurement into a posterior belief over distance requires inference with a prior. Usually, this prior represents beliefs about the stellar density distribution of the Milky Way. However, multiband photometry exists for a large fraction of the Gaia-TGAS Catalog and is incredibly informative about stellar distances. Here, we use 2MASS colors for 1.4 million TGAS stars to build a
noise-deconvolved empirical prior distribution for stars in
color-magnitude space. This model contains no knowledge of stellar astrophysics or the Milky Way but is precise because it accurately generates a large number of noisy parallax measurements under an assumption of stationarity; that is, it is capable of combining the information from many stars. We use the Extreme Deconvolution (XD) algorithm\textemdash which is an empirical-Bayes approximation to a
full-hierarchical model of the true parallax and photometry of every star\textemdash to construct this prior. The prior is combined with a TGAS
likelihood to infer a precise photometric-parallax estimate and
uncertainty (and full posterior) for every star. Our parallax estimates are more precise than the TGAS catalog entries by a median factor of 1.2 (14\% are more precise by a factor {$>$}2) and they are more precise than the previous Bayesian distance estimates that use spatial priors. We validate our parallax inferences using members of the Milky Way star cluster M67, which is not visible as a cluster in the TGAS parallax estimates but appears as a cluster in our posterior parallax estimates. Our results, including a parallax posterior probability distribution function for each of 1.4 million TGAS stars, are available in companion electronic tables.},

  abstract = {The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both the Sun and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a
redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent
hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully
considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine
meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

Observations of hydrogen and helium radio recombination lines between 8 and 10 GHz were made toward the peak radio continuum position in S206. We derive 4He/H=0.08459+/-0.00088 (random)+/-0.0010 (known systematic), 20\% lower than optical recombination line results. It is difficult to reconcile the large discrepancy between the optical and radio values even when accounting for temperature, density, and
ionization structure or for optical extinction by dust. Using only M17 and S206 we determine {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z=1.41+/-0.62 in the Galaxy,
consistent with standard chemical evolution models. High helium
abundances in the old stellar population of elliptical galaxies can help explain the increase in UV emission with shorter wavelength between 2000 and 1200 \AA, called the ``UV upturn'' or UVX. Our lower values of {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z are consistent with a normal helium abundance at
higher metallicity and suggest that other factors, such as a variable red giant branch mass loss with metallicity, may be important. When combined with 4He abundances in metal-poor galaxy H II regions, Magellanic Cloud H II regions, and M17 that have been
determined from optical recombination lines, including the effects of temperature fluctuations, our radio 4He/H abundance ratio for S206 is consistent with a helium evolution of {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z=1.6. A
linear extrapolation to zero metallicity predicts a 4He/H primordial abundance ratio about 5\% lower than that given by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and standard big bang
nucleosynthesis. The measured 4He abundances may be
systematically underestimated by a few percent if clumping exists in these H II regions.},

  abstract = {Methods. We used the Stellar Parameters in an Instant (SPI) pipeline to estimate the parameters of nearly 100 stars observed by Kepler and Gaia, many of which are confirmed planet hosts. We adjusted the reported spectroscopic measurements of these stars by introducing faux systematic errors and, separately, artificially increasing the reported uncertainties of the measurements, and quantified the differences in the resulting parameters.
Results. We find that a systematic error of 0.1 dex in [Fe/H] translates to differences of only 4\%, 2\%, and 1\% on average in the resulting stellar ages, masses, and radii, which are well within their uncertainties ({$\sim$}11\%, 3.5\%, 1.4\%) as derived by SPI. We also find that increasing the uncertainty of [Fe/H] measurements by 0.1 dex increases the uncertainties of the ages, masses, and radii by only 0.01 Gyr, 0.02 M , and 0.01 R , which are again well below their reported uncertainties ({$\sim$}0.5 Gyr, 0.04 M , 0.02 R ). The results for Teff at 100 K are similar.
Conclusions. Stellar parameters from SPI are unchanged within uncertainties by errors of up to 0.14 dex or 175 K. They are even more robust to errors in Teff than the seismic scaling relations. Consequently, the parameters for their exoplanets are also robust.},

We report revised radii of 177,911 Kepler stars derived by combining parallaxes from the Gaia Data Release 2 with the DR25 Kepler Stellar Properties Catalog. The median radius precision is {$\approx$}8\%, a typical improvement by a factor of 4\textendash 5 over previous estimates for typical Kepler stars. We find that {$\approx$}67\% ({$\approx$}120,000) of all Kepler targets are main-sequence stars, {$\approx$}21\% ({$\approx$}37,000) are subgiants, and {$\approx$}12\% ({$\approx$}21,000) are red giants, demonstrating that subgiant contamination is less severe than some previous estimates and that Kepler targets are mostly main-sequence stars. Using the revised stellar radii, we recalculate the radii for 2123 confirmed and 1922 candidate exoplanets. We confirm the presence of a gap in the radius distribution of small, close-in planets, but find that the gap is mostly limited to incident fluxes {$>$}200 F\AA, and its location may be at a slightly larger radius (closer to {$\approx$}2 R{$\oplus$}) when compared to previous results. Furthermore, we find several confirmed exoplanets occupying a previously described ``hot super-Earth desert'' at high irradiance, show the relation between a gas-giant planet's radius and its incident flux, and establish a bona fide sample of eight confirmed planets and 30 planet candidates with Rp {$<$} 2 R{$\oplus$} in circumstellar ``habitable zones'' (incident fluxes between 0.25 and 1.50 F\AA ).

  abstract = {Inferences about the spatial density or phase-space structure of stellar populations in the Milky Way require a precise determination of the effective survey volume. The volume observed by surveys such as Gaia or near-infrared spectroscopic surveys, which have good coverage of the Galactic midplane region, is highly complex because of the abundant small-scale structure in the three-dimensional interstellar dust extinction. We introduce a novel framework for analyzing the importance of small-scale structure in the extinction. This formalism demonstrates that the spatially complex effect of extinction on the selection function of a pencil-beam or contiguous sky survey is equivalent to a low-pass filtering of the extinction-affected selection function with the smooth density field. We find that the angular resolution of current 3D extinction maps is sufficient for analyzing Gaia sub-samples of millions of stars. However, the current distance resolution is
inadequate and needs to be improved by an order of magnitude, especially in the inner Galaxy. We also present a practical and efficient method for properly taking the effect of extinction into account in analyses of Galactic structure through an effective selection function. We
illustrate its use with the selection function of red-clump stars in APOGEE using and comparing a variety of current 3D extinction maps.},

  abstract = {Context. Models of stellar structure and evolution can be constrained by 
measuring accurate parameters of detached eclipsing binaries in open
clusters. Multiple binary stars provide the means to determine helium
abundances in these old stellar systems, and in turn, to improve
estimates of their age. Aims: In the first paper of this series,
we demonstrated how measurements of multiple eclipsing binaries in the
old open cluster NGC 6791 sets tighter constraints on the properties of
stellar models than has previously been possible, thereby potentially
improving both the accuracy and precision of the cluster age. Here we
add additional constraints and perform an extensive model comparison to
determine the best estimates of the cluster age and helium content,
employing as many observational constraints as possible. Methods:
We improve our photometry and correct empirically for differential
reddening effects. We then perform an extensive comparison of the new
colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and eclipsing binary measurements to
Victoria and DSEP isochrones in order to estimate cluster parameters. We
also reanalyse a spectrum of the star 2-17 to improve [Fe/H]
constraints. Results: We find a best estimate of the age of \textasciitilde 8.3
Gyr for NGC 6791 while demonstrating that remaining age uncertainty is
dominated by uncertainties in the CNO abundances. The helium mass
fraction is well constrained at Y = 0.30{$\pm$}0.01 resulting in
{$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z \textasciitilde{} 1.4 assuming that such a relation exists. During the
analysis we firmly identify blue straggler stars, including the star
2-17, and find indications for the presence of their evolved
counterparts. Our analysis supports the RGB mass-loss found from
asteroseismology and we determine precisely the absolute mass of stars
on the lower RGB, MRGB = 1.15{$\pm$}0.02 M{$\odot$}.
This will be an important consistency check for the detailed
asteroseismology of cluster stars. Conclusions: Using multiple,
detached eclipsing binaries for determining stellar cluster ages, it is
now possible to constrain parameters of stellar models, notably the
helium content, which were previously out of reach. By observing a
suitable number of detached eclipsing binaries in several open clusters,
it will be possible to calibrate the age-scale and the helium enrichment
parameter {$\Delta$} Y/{$\Delta$} Z, and provide firm constraints that stellar
models must reproduce.

computation of the autocorrelation of frequency-power spectra, and
computation of the power spectrum of the power spectrum. The values of
the large separations obtained by the different methods are offset from
each other and have differing sensitivities to the realization noise. A
simple model was used to predict solar-cycle variations in the large
separations, indicating that the variations are due to the well-known
solar-cycle changes to mode frequency. However, this model is only valid
over a restricted frequency range. We discuss the implications of these

migration, and tidal evolution. We seek empirical constraints on {$\psi$}
by measuring the stellar inclination Is via asteroseismology
for an ensemble of 25 solar-type hosts observed with NASA's Kepler
satellite. Our results for Is are consistent with alignment
at the 2{$\sigma$} level for all stars in the sample, meaning that the
system surrounding the red-giant star Kepler-56 remains as the only
unambiguous misaligned multiple-planet system detected to date. The
availability of a measurement of the projected spin-orbit angle {$\lambda$}
for two of the systems allows us to estimate {$\psi$}. We find that the
orbit of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b is likely to be retrograde (\textbackslash psi
=116\textbackslash buildrel\{\textbackslash circ\}\textbackslash over\{.\} \{4\}-14.7+30.2),
whereas that of Kepler-25c seems to be well aligned with the stellar
spin axis (\textbackslash psi =12\textbackslash buildrel\{\textbackslash circ\}\textbackslash over\{.\}
\{6\}-11.0+6.7). While the latter result is in
apparent contradiction with a statement made previously in the
literature that the multi-transiting system Kepler-25 is misaligned, we
show that the results are consistent, given the large associated
uncertainties. Finally, we perform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis
based on the asteroseismic sample in order to recover the underlying
distribution of {$\psi$}. The ensemble analysis suggests that the
directions of the stellar spin and planetary orbital axes are
correlated, as conveyed by a tendency of the host stars to display large
values of inclination.},

solar neighbourhood. Our sample of K dwarfs has homogeneously determined effective temperatures, bolometric luminosities and metallicities, allowing us to fit each star to the appropriate stellar isochrone and determine its helium content indirectly. We use a newly computed set of Padova isochrones which cover a wide range of helium and metal content.

Our theoretical isochrones have been checked against a congruous set of main-sequence binaries with accurately measured masses, to discuss and validate their range of applicability. We find that the stellar masses deduced from the isochrones are usually in excellent agreement with empirical measurements. Good agreement is also found with empirical mass-luminosity relations.

Despite fitting the masses of the stars very well, we find that
anomalously low helium content (lower than primordial helium) is required to fit the luminosities and temperatures of the metal-poor K dwarfs, while more conventional values of the helium content are derived for the stars around solar metallicity.

We have investigated the effect of diffusion in stellar models and the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in deriving
metallicities. Neither of these is able to resolve the low-helium problem alone and only marginally if the cumulated effects are included, unless we assume a mixing-length which is strongly decreasing with metallicity. Further work in stellar models is urgently needed.

The helium-to-metal enrichment ratio is found to be {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z =
2.1 +/- 0.9 around and above solar metallicity, consistent with previous studies, whereas open problems still remain at the lowest metallicities. Finally, we determine the helium content for a set of planetary host stars.},

astrometric and photometric measurements. Using a cross-matched sample of red clump stars from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment and Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2), we report the parallax zero-point offset in DR2 to be {$\pi\_$}0 = -48 {$\pm$} 1 {$\mu$} as. We infer

Their existence is not explained by standard chemical evolution models of the Milky Way, and shows that the chemical-enrichment history of the Galactic disc is more complex. We find similar stars in previously published samples for which isochrone-ages could be reliably obtained, although in smaller relative numbers. This might explain why these stars have not previously received attention. The young [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-rich stars are much more numerous in the CoRoT-APOGEE (CoRoGEE) inner-field sample than in any other high-resolution sample available at present because only CoRoGEE can explore the inner-disc regions and provide ages for its field stars. The kinematic properties of the young [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-rich stars are not clearly thick-disc like, despite their rather large distances from the Galactic mid-plane. Our tentative interpretation of these and previous intriguing observations in the Milky Way is that these stars were formed close to the end of the Galactic bar, near corotation \textendash{} a region where gas can be kept inert for longer times than in other regions that are more frequently shocked by the passage of spiral arms. Moreover, this is where the mass return from older inner-disc stellar generations is expected to be highest (according to an inside-out disc-formation scenario), which additionally dilutes the in-situ gas. Other possibilities to explain these observations (e.g., a recent gas-accretion event) are also discussed.},

The core of the approach is a Bayesian artificial neural network (ANN) that learns from and completely replaces stellar isochrones. The ANN is trained using a sample of red giant stars with mass estimates from asteroseismology. A Bayesian isochrone pipeline uses the astrometric, photometric, spectroscopic, and asteroseismology data to determine posterior distributions for the training outputs: mass, age, and distance. Given new inputs, posterior predictive distributions for the outputs are computed, taking into account both input uncertainties, and uncertainties in the ANN parameters. We apply MADE to 10 000 red giants in the overlap between the 14th data release from the APO Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and the Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution (TGAS). The ANN is able to reduce the uncertainty on mass, age, and distance estimates for training-set stars with high output uncertainties allocated through the Bayesian isochrone pipeline. The fractional uncertainties on mass are \&lt; 10 per cent and on age are between 10 to 25 per cent. Moreover, the time taken for our ANN to predict masses, ages, and distances for the entire catalogue of APOGEE-TGAS stars is of a similar order of the time taken by the Bayesian isochrone pipeline to run on a handful of stars. Our resulting catalogue clearly demonstrates the expected thick- and thin-disc components in the [M/H]-[{$\alpha$}/M] plane, when examined by age.},

  abstract = {The solar analogues 16 Cyg A and B are excellent asteroseismic targets 
in the Kepler field of view and together with a red dwarf and a Jovian
planet form an interesting system. For these more evolved Sun-like stars
we cannot detect surface rotation with the current Kepler data but
instead use the technique of asteroseimology to determine rotational
properties of both 16 Cyg A and B. We find the rotation periods to be
23.8\^\{+1.5\}\_\{-1.8\} and 23.2\^\{+11.5\}\_\{-3.2\} d, and the angles of
inclination to be 56\^\{+6\}\_\{-5\}\textdegree{} and 36\^\{+17\}\_\{-7\}\textdegree, for A and B,
respectively. Together with these results we use the published mass and
age to suggest that, under the assumption of a solar-like rotation
profile, 16 Cyg A could be used when calibrating gyrochronology
relations. In addition, we discuss the known 16 Cyg B star-planet
eccentricity and measured low obliquity which is consistent with Kozai
cycling and tidal theory.},

  abstract = {Asteroseismology has started to provide constraints on stellar properties that will be essential to accurately reconstruct the history of the Milky Way. Here we look at the information content in data sets representing current and future space missions (CoRoT, Kepler, K2, TESS, and PLATO) for red giant stars. We describe techniques for extracting the information in the frequency power spectrum and apply these
techniques to Kepler data sets of different observing length to
represent the different space missions. We demonstrate that for KIC 12008916, a low-luminosity red giant branch star, we can extract useful information from all data sets, and for all but the shortest data set we obtain good constraint on the g-mode period spacing and core rotation rates. We discuss how the high precision in these parameters will constrain the stellar properties of stellar radius, distance, mass and age. We show that high precision can be achieved in mass and hence age when values of the g-mode period spacing are available. We caution that tests to establish the accuracy of asteroseismic masses and ages are still ``work in progress''.},

The new computations include a more complete equation of state (EOS) with more grain species and updated optical constants. Grains are now explicitly included in thermal equilibrium in the EOS calculation, which allows for a much wider range of grain compositions to be accurately included than was previously the case. The inclusion of high-temperature condensates such as Al2O3 and CaTiO3 significantly affects the total opacity over a narrow range of
temperatures before the appearance of the first silicate grains. The new opacity tables are tabulated for temperatures ranging from 30,000 to 500 K with gas densities from 10-4 to 10-19 g
cm-3. Comparisons with previous Rosseland mean opacity calculations are discussed. At high temperatures, the agreement with OPAL and Opacity Project is quite good. Comparisons at lower
temperatures are more divergent as a result of differences in molecular and grain physics included in different calculations. The computation of Planck mean opacities performed with the opacity sampling method is shown to require a very large number of opacity sampling wavelength points; previously published results obtained with fewer wavelength points are shown to be significantly in error. Methods for requesting or obtaining the new tables are provided.},

The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to \texttildelow N2 for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our
implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort. The code is available online at http://dan.iel.fm/emcee under the GNU General Public License v2.},

  abstract = {A star in the Milky Way's disk can now be at a Galactocentric radius quite distant from its birth radius for two reasons: either its orbit has become eccentric through radial heating, which increases its radial action \$J\_R\$ (`blurring'); or merely its angular momentum \$L\_z\$ has changed and thereby its guiding radius (`churning'). We know that radial orbit migration is strong in the Galactic low-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ disk and set out to quantify the relative importance of these two effects, by devising and applying a parameterized model for the distribution \$p(L\_z, J\_R, \textbackslash tau, \textbackslash mathrm[Fe/H])\$ in the stellar disk. This model describes the orbit evolution for stars of age \$\textbackslash tau\$ and metallicity [Fe/H],
presuming coeval stars were initially born on (near-)circular orbits, and with a unique [Fe/H] at a given birth angular momentum and age. We fit this model to APOGEE red clump stars, accounting for the complex selection function of the survey. The best fit model implies changes of angular momentum of \$\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash langle \textbackslash Delta L\_z \textbackslash rangle\^2\} \textbackslash approx 619\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{kpc\textasciitilde km/s\textasciitilde\}(\textbackslash tau/\textbackslash mathrm\{6\textasciitilde Gyr\})\^\{0.5\}\$, and changes of radial action as \$\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash langle \textbackslash Delta J\_R \textbackslash rangle\^2\} \textbackslash approx 63\textbackslash,
\textbackslash mathrm\{kpc\textasciitilde km/s\textasciitilde\} (\textbackslash tau/\textbackslash mathrm\{6\textasciitilde Gyr\})\^\{0.6\}\$ at 8 kpc. This suggests that the secular orbit evolution of the disk is dominated by diffusion in angular momentum, with radial heating being an order of magnitude lower.},

  abstract = {Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system. Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey.
Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the
first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data
Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second
data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1
in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data
products. Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the
apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3
billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition
available. The sample of sources for which variability information is
provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains
four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the
apparent brightness in the GBP (330-680 nm) and
GRP (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources;
median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for
between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar
effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity;
and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system
epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also
represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the
optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based
solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the
photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia
DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as
independent. Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement
for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide
parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing
a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and
source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia
survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our
galaxy.},

  abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the
scientific community focusses on data processing for which the
international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and
subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built
spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page.

The high quality of the collected seismic data and the subsequent theoretical work for interpreting them brought up a series of issues which revealed that our knowledge of the internal properties of red giant stars remains quite limited. Two such important issues are discussed here, namely mixing beyond the convective core of helium burning red giant stars and evolution of internal angular momentum for post main sequence stars. This includes how they were diagnosed and what are the resulting improvements in our understanding regarding these issues (or rather how far we are from a proper understanding and realistic modelling of the structure and evolution of post main sequence stars).},

a few kiloparsecs. This new map contains three major improvements over our previous work. First, the inclusion of Gaia parallaxes dramatically improves distance estimates to nearby stars. Second, we incorporate a spatial prior that correlates the dust density across nearby sightlines. This produces a smoother map, with more isotropic clouds and smaller distance uncertainties, particularly to clouds within the nearest kiloparsec. Third, we infer the dust density with a distance resolution that is four times finer than in our previous work, to accommodate the improvements in signal-to-noise enabled by the other improvements. As part of this work, we infer the distances, reddenings, and types of 799 million stars.

spread in luminosity, thus functioning as standard candles to calibrate these systematics. This work measures how the magnitude and spread of the RC in the Kepler field are affected by changes to temperature and scaling relations for seismology, and changes to the parallax zero-point for Gaia. We use a sample of 5576 RC stars classified through
asteroseismology. We apply hierarchical Bayesian latent variable models, finding the population-level properties of the RC with seismology, and use those as priors on Gaia parallaxes to find {$\varpi$}zp. We then find the position of the RC, using published values for
{$\varpi$}zp. We find a seismic temperature-insensitive spread of the RC of \{{$\sim$} \}0.03 mag in the 2MASS K band and a larger and slightly temperature-dependent spread of \{{$\sim$} \}0.13 mag in the Gaia G band. This intrinsic dispersion in the K band provides a distance precision of \{{$\sim$} \} 1\{\{ per cent\}\} for RC stars. Using Gaia data alone, we find a mean zero-point of -41{$\pm$} 10 {$\mu$} as. This offset yields RC
absolute magnitudes of -1.634 {$\pm$} 0.018 in K and 0.546 {$\pm$}
0.016 in G. Obtaining these same values through seismology would require a global temperature shift of \{{$\sim$} \}-70 K, which is compatible with known systematics in spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {Distances to individual stars in our own Galaxy are critical in order to 
piece together the nature of its velocity and spatial structure. Core
helium burning red clump (RC) stars have similar luminosities, are
abundant throughout the Galaxy and thus constitute good standard
candles. We build a hierarchical probabilistic model to quantify the
quality of RC stars as standard candles using parallax measurements from
the first Gaia data release. A unique aspect of our methodology is to
fully account for (and marginalize over) parallax, photometry and dust
correction uncertainties, which lead to more robust results than
standard approaches. We determine the absolute magnitude and intrinsic
dispersion of the RC in 2MASS bands J, H, Ks, Gaia G band and
WISE bands W1, W2, W3 and W4. We find that the absolute magnitude of the
RC is -1.61 {$\pm$} 0.01 (in Ks), +0.44 {$\pm$} 0.01 (in
G), -0.93 {$\pm$} 0.01 (in J), -1.46 {$\pm$} 0.01 (in H), -1.68

dispersion is {$\sim$}0.17 {$\pm$} 0.03 mag across all bands (yielding a
typical distance precision of {$\sim$}8 per cent). Thus RC stars are
reliable and precise standard candles. In addition, we have also
re-calibrated the zero-point of the absolute magnitude of the RC in each
band, which provides a benchmark for future studies to estimate
distances to RC stars. Finally, the parallax error shrinkage in the
hierarchical model outlined in this work can be used to obtain more
precise parallaxes than Gaia for the most distant RC stars across the
Galaxy.},

  abstract = {Context. The length of the asteroseismic timeseries obtained from the 
Kepler satellite analysed here span 19 months. Kepler provides the
longest continuous timeseries currently available, which calls for a
study of the influence of the increased timespan on the accuracy and
precision of the obtained results. Aims: We aim to investigate
how the increased timespan influences the detectability of the
oscillation modes, and the absolute values and uncertainties of the
global oscillation parameters, i.e., frequency of maximum oscillation
power, {$\nu$}max, and large frequency separation between modes
of the same degree and consecutive orders, {$\langle$} {$\Delta\nu$} {$\rangle$} .
 Methods: We use published methods to derive {$\nu$}max
and {$\langle$} {$\Delta\nu$} {$\rangle$} for timeseries ranging from 50 to 600 days
and compare these results as a function of method, timespan and {$\langle$}
{$\Delta\nu$} {$\rangle$} . Results: We find that in general a minimum
of the order of 400 day long timeseries are necessary to obtain reliable
results for the global oscillation parameters in more than 95\% of the
stars, but this does depend on {$\langle$} {$\Delta\nu$} {$\rangle$} . In a
statistical sense the quoted uncertainties seem to provide a reasonable
indication of the precision of the obtained results in short (50-day)
runs, they do however seem to be overestimated for results of longer
runs. Furthermore, the different definitions of the global parameters
used in the different methods have non-negligible effects on the
obtained values. Additionally, we show that there is a correlation
between {$\nu$}max and the flux variance. Conclusions: We
conclude that longer timeseries improve the likelihood to detect
oscillations with automated codes (from \textasciitilde 60\% in 50 day runs to {$>$}95\%
in 400 day runs with a slight method dependence) and the precision of
the obtained global oscillation parameters. The trends suggest that the
improvement will continue for even longer timeseries than the 600 days
considered here, with a reduction in the median absolute deviation of
more than a factor of 10 for an increase in timespan from 50 to 2000
days (the currently foreseen length of the mission). This work shows
that global parameters determined with high precision - thus from long
datasets - using different definitions can be used to identify the
evolutionary state of the stars.

stars. The evolution models constitute a 6D parameter space and their
predicted low-degree pressure- and gravity-mode oscillations are scanned
using a genetic algorithm. A software pipeline is created to find the
best-fitting stellar parameters for a given set of observed oscillation
frequencies. The proposed method finds the optimal regions in the 6D
parameter space in less than a minute, hence providing the optimal
starting point for further and more detailed forward asteroseismic
modeling in a high-dimensional context. We test and apply the method to
seven pulsating stars that were previously modeled asteroseismically by
classical grid-based forward modeling based on a {$\chi$} 2
statistic, and obtain good agreement with past results. Our
deep-learning methodology opens up the application of asteroseismic
modeling in +6D parameter space for thousands of stars pulsating in
coherent modes with long lifetimes observed by the Kepler space
telescope and to be discovered with the TESS and PLATO space missions,
while applications so far have been done star-by-star for only a handful
of cases. Our method is open source and can be freely used by
anyone.3},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the
uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

We give advice on method choice, tuning for performance, methods for initialization, tests of convergence, troubleshooting, and use of the chain output to produce or report parameter estimates with associated uncertainties. We argue that autocorrelation time is the most important test for convergence, as it directly connects to the uncertainty on the sampling estimate of any quantity of interest.

  abstract = {Time-resolved photometry of tens of thousands of red giant stars from space missions like Kepler and K2 has created the need for automated asteroseismic analysis methods. The first and most fundamental step in such analysis is to identify which stars show oscillations. It is critical that this step be performed with no, or little, detection bias, particularly when performing subsequent ensemble analyses that aim to compare the properties of observed stellar populations with those from galactic models. However, an efficient, automated solution to this initial detection step still has not been found, meaning that expert visual inspection of data from each star is required to obtain the highest level of detections. Hence, to mimic how an expert eye analyzes the data, we use supervised deep learning to not only detect oscillations in red giants, but also to predict the location of the frequency at maximum power, {$\nu$}max, by observing features in 2D images of power spectra. By training on Kepler data, we benchmark our deep-learning classifier against K2 data that are given detections by the expert eye, achieving a detection accuracy of 98\% on K2 Campaign 6 stars and a detection accuracy of 99\% on K2 Campaign 3 stars. We further find that the estimated uncertainty of our deep-learning-based {$\nu$}max predictions is about 5\%. This is comparable to human-level performance using visual inspection. When examining outliers, we find that the deep-learning results are more likely to provide robust {$\nu$}max estimates than the classical model-fitting method.},

difference of the {$\Delta\nu$}-{$\nu$}max relation for unevolved
and evolved stars can be explained by different distributions in
effective temperature and stellar mass, in agreement with what is
expected from scaling relations. For oscillation amplitudes, we show
that neither (L/M) s scaling nor the revised scaling
relation by Kjeldsen \& Bedding is accurate for red-giant stars, and
demonstrate that a revised scaling relation with a separate
luminosity-mass dependence can be used to calculate amplitudes from the
main sequence to red giants to a precision of \textasciitilde 25\%. The residuals show
an offset particularly for unevolved stars, suggesting that an
additional physical dependency is necessary to fully reproduce the
observed amplitudes. We investigate correlations between amplitudes and
stellar activity, and find evidence that the effect of amplitude
suppression is most pronounced for subgiant stars. Finally, we test the
location of the cool edge of the instability strip in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram using solar-like oscillations and find the
detections in the hottest stars compatible with a domain of hybrid
stochastically excited and opacity driven pulsation.},

Primarily designed to detect planetary transits and asteroseismological signals from solar-like stars, Kepler has provided high-quality data for many areas of investigation. Unconditioned simple aperture time-series photometry is, however, affected by systematic structure. Examples of these systematics include differential velocity aberration, thermal gradients across the spacecraft, and pointing variations. While
exhibiting some impact on Kepler's primary science, these
systematics can critically handicap potentially ground-breaking
scientific gains in other astrophysical areas, especially over long timescales greater than 10 days. As the data archive grows to provide light curves for 105 stars of many years in length, Kepler will only fulfill its broad potential for stellar astrophysics if these systematics are understood and mitigated. Post-launch developments in the Kepler archive, data reduction pipeline and open source data analysis software have helped to remove or reduce systematic artifacts. This paper provides a conceptual primer to help users of the Kepler data archive understand and recognize systematic artifacts within light curves and some methods for their removal. Specific examples of artifact mitigation are provided using data available within the archive. Through the methods defined here, the Kepler community will find a road map to maximizing the quality and employment of the Kepler legacy archive.},

We successfully apply this technique to an artificial data set with an underlying isotropic inclination angle distribution to verify the method. We also apply this technique to 123 red giant stars observed with Kepler. We also show the need for a selection function to account for possible population-level biases, which are not present in

this approach on the 1.4 million stars of the Gaia TGAS sample that also

  abstract = {Context. Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) contains results for 1693 million sources in the magnitude range 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 22 months of its operational phase. Aims: We describe the input data, models, and processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia DR2, and the validation of these resultsperformed within the astrometry task. Methods: Some 320 billion centroid positions from the pre-processed astrometric CCD observations were used to estimate the five astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1332 million sources, and approximate positions at the reference epoch J2015.5 for an additional 361 million mostly faint sources. These data were calculated in two steps. First, the satellite attitude and the astrometric calibration parameters of the CCDs were obtained in an astrometric global iterative solution for 16 million selected sources, using about 1\% of the input data. This primary solution was tied to the extragalactic International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by means of quasars. The resulting attitude and calibration were then used to calculate the astrometric parameters of all the sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion. Results: For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (G {$<$} 14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at G = 17 mag, and 0.7 masat G = 20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding
uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas yr-1,
respectively.The optical reference frame defined by Gaia DR2 is aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to the quasars to within 0.15 mas yr-1. From the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas yr-1 in proper motion are seen on small ({$<$} 1 deg) and intermediate (20 deg) angular scales. Important statistics and information for the users of the Gaia DR2 astrometry are given in the appendices.},

  abstract = {Aims: We investigate the relation between 1D atmosphere models 
that rely on the mixing length theory and models based on full 3D
radiative hydrodynamic (RHD) calculations to describe convection in the
envelopes of late-type stars. Methods: The adiabatic entropy
value of the deep convection zone, sbot, and the entropy
jump, {$\Delta$}s, determined from the 3D RHD models, were matched with the
mixing length parameter, {$\alpha$}MLT, from 1D hydrostatic
atmosphere models with identical microphysics (opacities and
equation-of-state). We also derived the mass mixing length parameter,
{$\alpha$}m, and the vertical correlation length of the vertical
velocity, C[vz,vz], directly from the 3D
hydrodynamical simulations of stellar subsurface convection. 
Results: The calibrated mixing length parameter for the Sun is
{$\alpha$}๏MLT (Sbot) = 1.98. . For
different stellar parameters, {$\alpha$}MLT varies
systematically in the range of 1.7 - 2.4. In particular,
{$\alpha$}MLT decreases towards higher effective temperature,
lower surface gravity and higher metallicity. We find equivalent results
for {$\alpha$}๏MLT ({$\Delta$}S). In addition, we
find a tight correlation between the mixing length parameter and the
inverse entropy jump. We derive an analytical expression from the
hydrodynamic mean-field equations that motivates the relation to the
mass mixing length parameter, {$\alpha$}m, and find that it
qualitatively shows a similar variation with stellar parameter (between
1.6 and 2.4) with the solar value of
{$\alpha$}๏m = 1.83.. The vertical correlation
length scaled with the pressure scale height yields 1.71 for the Sun,
but only displays a small systematic variation with stellar parameters,
the correlation length slightly increases with Teff. 
Conclusions: We derive mixing length parameters for various stellar
parameters that can be used to replace a constant value. Within any
convective envelope, {$\alpha$}m and related quantities vary
strongly. Our results will help to replace a constant
{$\alpha$}MLT.

Specifically, we employ a statistical multilevel modelling technique,
Bayesian hierarchical modelling, to simultaneously constrain the
properties of individual Local Group Milky Way satellite galaxies and
the characteristics of the Milky Way satellite population. We show that
this methodology reduces the uncertainty in individual dwarf galaxy mass
measurements up to a factor of a few for the faintest galaxies. We find
that the distribution of Milky Way satellites inferred by this analysis,
with the exception of the apparent lack of high-mass haloes, is
consistent with the {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) paradigm. In
particular, we find that both the measured relationship between the
maximum circular velocity and the radius at this velocity, as well as
the inferred relationship between the mass within 300 pc and luminosity,
match the values predicted by {$\Lambda$}CDM simulations for haloes with
maximum circular velocities below 20 km s-1. Perhaps more
striking is that this analysis seems to suggest a more cusped `average'
halo shape that is shared by these galaxies. While this study reconciles
many of the observed properties of the Milky Way satellite distribution
with that of {$\Lambda$}CDM simulations, we find that there is still a
deficit of satellites with maximum circular velocities of 20-40 km

  abstract = {Context. Asteroseismology allows us to probe the physical conditions 
inside the core of red giant stars. This process relies on the
properties of the global oscillations with a mixed character that are
highly sensitive to the physical properties of the core. However,
overlapping rotational splittings and mixed-mode spacings result in
complex structures in the mixed-mode pattern, which severely complicates
its identification and the measurement of the asymptotic period spacing.
 Aims: This work aims at disentangling the rotational splittings
from the mixed-mode spacings in order to open the way to a fully
automated analysis of large data sets. Methods: An analytical
development of the mixed-mode asymptotic expansion is used to derive the
period spacing between two consecutive mixed modes. The \'echelle
diagrams constructed with the appropriately stretched periods are used
to exhibit the structure of the gravity modes and of the rotational
splittings. Results: We propose a new view of the mixed-mode
oscillation pattern based on corrected periods, called stretched
periods, that mimic the evenly spaced gravity-mode pattern. This
provides a direct understanding of all oscillation components, even in
the case of rapid rotation. In this way, the measurement of the
asymptotic period spacing and the signature of the structural glitches
on mixed modes can be performed easily. Conclusions: This work
makes it possible to derive all seismic global parameters in an
automated way, including the identification of the different rotational
multiplets and the measurement of the rotational splitting, even when
this splitting is significantly larger than the period spacing.

of correlations between some abundance ratios and stellar age providing

with asteroseismic ages in order to test the solar twin relations. Methods: HARPS-N spectra with signal-to-noise ratios S/N {$\greaterequivlnt$} 250
and MARCS model atmospheres were used to derive abundances of C, O, Na,
Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, and Y in ten stars from the Kepler
LEGACY sample (including the binary pair 16 Cyg A and B) selected to
have metallicities in the range - 0.15 {$<$} [ Fe / H ] {$<$} + 0.15 and
ages between 1 and 7 Gyr. Stellar gravities were obtained from seismic
data and effective temperatures were determined by comparing non-LTE
iron abundances derived from Fe I and Fe II lines. Available non-LTE
corrections were also applied when deriving abundances of the other
elements. Results: The abundances of the Kepler stars support the
[X/Fe]-age relations previously found for solar twins. [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe],
and [Zn/Fe] decrease by 0.1 dex over the lifetime of the Galactic thin
disk due to delayed contribution of iron from Type Ia supernovae
relative to prompt production of Mg, Al, and Zn in Type II supernovae.
[Y/Mg] and [Y/Al], on the other hand, increase by 0.3 dex, which can
be explained by an increasing contribution of s-process elements from
low-mass AGB stars as time goes on. The trends of [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] are
more complicated due to variations of the ratio between refractory and
volatile elements among stars of similar age. Two stars with about the
same age as the Sun show very different trends of [X/H] as a function of
elemental condensation temperature Tc and for 16 Cyg, the two
components have an abundance difference, which increases with
Tc. These anomalies may be connected to planet-star
interactions.

Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate
independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the
extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete
evolutionary track of a 1 M sun star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star.

The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based
Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS
adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a numerical
recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when
many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the
way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline
mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M {$\odot$} stars through
the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival
on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular
momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of
rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We
introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows
the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This
enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst,
and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way
in which MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and

MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the

mass accretion, giving more accurate and robust near-surface profiles. A
new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction rates
``on-the-fly'' from input nuclear data allows better
simulation of accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the
fate of some massive stars. We discuss the ongoing challenge of chemical
diffusion in the strongly coupled plasma regime, and exhibit
improvements in MESA that now allow for the simulation of radiative

to improved treatments of element diffusion, latent heat release, and

stars are extended in MESA by our addition of an approximate Riemann
solver that captures shocks and conserves energy to high accuracy during
dynamic epochs. We also introduce a 1D capability for modeling the
effects of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that, in combination with
the coupling to a public version of the STELLA radiation transfer
instrument, creates new avenues for exploring Type II supernova
properties. These capabilities are exhibited with exploratory models of
pair-instability supernovae, pulsational pair-instability supernovae,
and the formation of stellar-mass black holes. The applicability of MESA
is now widened by the capability to import multidimensional hydrodynamic
models into MESA. We close by introducing software modules for handling
floating point exceptions and stellar model optimization, as well as
four new software tools - MESA-Web, MESA-Docker, pyMESA, and
mesastar.org - to enhance MESA's education and research impact.},

We compare our temperature scale to the published infrared flux method (IRFM) scale for VTJKs in both open clusters and the Kepler fields. We find good agreement overall, with some deviations between (J - Ks )-based temperatures
from the IRFM and both SDSS filter and other diagnostic IRFM
color-temperature relationships above 6000 K. For field dwarfs, we find a mean shift toward hotter temperatures relative to the KIC, of order 215 K, in the regime where the IRFM scale is well defined (4000 K to 6500 K). This change is of comparable magnitude in both color systems and in spectroscopy for stars with T eff below 6000 K. Systematic differences between temperature estimators appear for hotter stars, and we define corrections to put the SDSS temperatures on the IRFM scale for them. When the theoretical dependence on gravity is accounted for, we find a similar temperature scale offset between the fundamental and KIC scales for giants. We demonstrate that statistical corrections to color-based temperatures from binaries are significant. Typical errors, mostly from uncertainties in extinction, are of order 100 K.

Currently, the most successful and widely-used activation function is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Although various hand-designed alternatives to ReLU have been proposed, none have managed to replace it due to inconsistent gains. In this work, we propose to leverage automatic search techniques to discover new activation functions. Using a combination of exhaustive and reinforcement learning-based search, we discover multiple novel activation functions. We verify the effectiveness of the searches by conducting an empirical evaluation with the best discovered activation function. Our experiments show that the best discovered activation function, \$f(x) = x \textbackslash cdot \textbackslash text\{sigmoid\}(\textbackslash beta x)\$, which we name Swish, tends to work better than ReLU on deeper models across a number of challenging datasets. For example, simply replacing ReLUs with Swish units improves top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet by 0.9\textbackslash\% for Mobile NASNet-A and 0.6\textbackslash\% for Inception-ResNet-v2. The simplicity of Swish and its similarity to ReLU make it easy for practitioners to replace ReLUs with Swish units in any neural network.},

  abstract = {Context. Detailed oscillation spectra comprising individual frequencies 
for numerous solar-type stars and red giants are either currently
available, e.g. courtesy of the CoRoT, Kepler, and K2 missions, or will
become available with the upcoming NASA TESS and ESA PLATO 2.0 missions.
The data can lead to a precise characterisation of these stars thereby
improving our understanding of stellar evolution, exoplanetary systems,
and the history of our galaxy. Aims: Our goal is to test and
compare different methods for obtaining stellar properties from
oscillation frequencies and spectroscopic constraints. Specifically, we
would like to evaluate the accuracy of the results and reliability of
the associated error bars, and to see where there is room for
improvement. Methods: In the context of the SpaceInn network, we
carried out a hare-and-hounds exercise in which one group, the hares,
simulated observations of oscillation spectra for a set of ten
artificial solar-type stars, and a number of hounds applied various
methods for characterising these stars based on the data produced by the
hares. Most of the hounds fell into two main groups. The first group
used forward modelling (I.e. applied various search/optimisation
algorithms in a stellar parameter space) whereas the second group relied
on acoustic glitch signatures. Results: Results based on the
forward modelling approach were accurate to 1.5\% (radius), 3.9\% (mass),
23\% (age), 1.5\% (surface gravity), and 1.8\% (mean density), as based on
the root mean square difference. Individual hounds reached different
degrees of accuracy, some of which were substantially better than the
above average values. For the two 1M{$\odot$} stellar targets,
the accuracy on the age is better than 10\% thereby satisfying the
requirements for the PLATO 2.0 mission. High stellar masses and atomic
diffusion (which in our models does not include the effects of radiative
accelerations) proved to be sources of difficulty. The average
accuracies for the acoustic radii of the base of the convection zone,
the He II ionisation, and the {$\Gamma$}1 peak located between
the two He ionisation zones were 17\%, 2.4\%, and 1.9\%, respectively. The
results from the forward modelling were on average more accurate than
those from the glitch fitting analysis as the latter seemed to be
affected by aliasing problems for some of the targets. 
Conclusions: Our study indicates that forward modelling is the most
accurate way of interpreting the pulsation spectra of solar-type stars.
However, given its model-dependent nature, this method needs to be
complemented by model-independent results from, e.g. glitch analysis.
Furthermore, our results indicate that global rather than local
optimisation algorithms should be used in order to obtain robust error
bars.},

effective temperatures. A sample of 50 suitable systems was collected
from the literature, and their effective temperatures were carefully
re-determined. The chemical composition of each of the systems was
obtained by comparison with stellar evolutionary models, under the
assumption that they should fit an isochrone to the observed properties
of the components. Evolutionary models covering a wide grid in Z and Y
were adopted for our study. An algorithm was developed for searching the
best-fitting chemical composition (and the age) for the systems, based
on the minimization of a {$\chi$}2 function. The errors (and
biases) of these parameters were estimated by means of Monte Carlo
simulations, with special care put on the correlations existing between
the errors of both components. In order to check the physical
consistency of the results, we compared our metallicity values with
empirical determinations, obtaining excellent coherence. The
independently derived Z and Y values yielded a determination of the
chemical enrichment law via weighted linear least-squares fit. Our value
of the slope, {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z=2.2+/-0.8, is in good agreement with
recent results, but it has a smaller formal error and it is free of
systematic effects. Linear extrapolation of the enrichment law to zero
metals leads to an estimation of the primordial helium abundance of
Yp=0.225+/-0.013, possibly affected by systematics in the

The results of an extensive Kepler follow-up program including multiple Doppler measurements for 22 planet-hosting stars more than doubles the population of sub-Neptune-sized transiting planets that have RV mass constraints. This unprecedentedly large and homogeneous sample of planets with both mass and radius constraints opens the possibility of a statistical study of the underlying population of planet compositions. We focus on the intriguing transition between rocky exoplanets (comprised of iron and silicates) and planets with voluminous layers of volatiles (H/He and astrophysical ices). Applying a
hierarchical Bayesian statistical approach to the sample of Kepler transiting sub-Neptune planets with Keck RV follow-up, we constrain the fraction of close-in planets (with orbital periods less than {$\sim$}50 days) that are sufficiently dense to be rocky, as a function of planet radius. We show that the majority of 1.6 \{\{R\}\textbackslash oplus \} planets have too low density to be comprised of Fe and silicates alone. At larger radii, the constraints on the fraction of rocky planets are even more stringent. These insights into the size demographics of rocky and volatile-rich planets offer empirical constraints to planet formation theories, and guide the range of planet radii to be considered in studies of the occurrence rate of ``Earth-like'' planets,

periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data

periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of
detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method
for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if

We use these dependencies to determine the correlation between Y ini and Y surf and use this correlation to eliminate uncertainties in Y ini from all solar model input parameters except the microscopic diffusion rate. We find an expression for Y ini that depends only on Y surf and the diffusion rate. By adopting the helioseismic determination of solar surface helium abundance, Y surf sun = 0.2485 {$\pm$} 0.0035, and an uncertainty of 20\% for the diffusion
rate, we find that the initial solar helium abundance, Y ini sun, is 0.278 {$\pm$} 0.006 independently of the reference
SSMs (and particularly on the adopted solar abundances) used in the derivation of the correlation between Y ini and Y
surf. When non-SSMs with extra mixing are used, then we derive Y ini sun = 0.273 {$\pm$} 0.006. In both

Asteroseismic data for our sample of 415 objects have been obtained by the Kepler mission in short (58.5 s) cadence, and light curves span from 30 up to more than 1000 days. The spectroscopic parameters are based on spectra taken as part of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment and correspond to Data Release 13 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We analyze our data using two independent \{T\}\{eff\} scales, the spectroscopic values from DR13 and those derived from SDSS griz photometry. We use the differences in our results arising from these choices as a test of systematic temperature uncertainties and find that they can lead to significant differences in the derived stellar properties.
Determinations of surface gravity (\{log\}g), mean density ({$<$} {$\rho$}
{$>$} ), radius (R), mass (M), and age ({$\tau$}) for the whole sample have been carried out by means of (stellar) grid-based modeling. We have thoroughly assessed random and systematic error sources in the
spectroscopic and asteroseismic data, as well as in the grid-based modeling determination of the stellar quantities provided in the catalog. We provide stellar properties determined for each of the two \{T\}\{eff\} scales. The median combined (random and systematic) uncertainties are 2\% (0.01 dex; \{log\}g), 3.4\% ({$<$} {$\rho$} {$>$} ), 2.6\%
(R), 5.1\% (M), and 19\% ({$\tau$}) for the photometric \{T\}\{eff\} scale and 2\% (\{log\}g), 3.5\% ({$<$} {$\rho$} {$>$} ), 2.7\% (R), 6.3\% (M), and
23\% ({$\tau$}) for the spectroscopic scale. We present comparisons with stellar quantities in the asteroseismic catalog by Chaplin et al. that highlight the importance of having metallicity measurements for
determining stellar parameters accurately. Finally, we compare our results with those coming from a variety of sources, including stellar radii determined from TGAS parallaxes and asteroseismic analyses based on individual frequencies. We find a very good agreement for all inferred quantities. The latter comparison, in particular, gives strong support to the determination of stellar quantities based on global seismology, a relevant result for future missions such as TESS and PLATO.},

  abstract = {In astrophysics, we often aim to estimate one or more parameters for each member object in a population and study the distribution of the fitted parameters across the population. In this paper, we develop novel methods that allow us to take advantage of existing software designed for such case-by-case analyses to simultaneously fit parameters of both the individual objects and the parameters that quantify their
distribution across the population. Our methods are based on Bayesian hierarchical modelling that is known to produce parameter estimators for the individual objects that are on average closer to their true values than estimators based on case-by-case analyses. We verify this in the context of estimating ages of Galactic halo white dwarfs (WDs) via a series of simulation studies. Finally, we deploy our new techniques on optical and near-infrared photometry of 10 candidate halo WDs to obtain estimates of their ages along with an estimate of the mean age of Galactic halo WDs of 12.11\_\{-0.86\}\^\{+0.85\} Gyr. Although this sample is small, our technique lays the ground work for large-scale studies using data from the Gaia mission.},

We implement a new Bayesian scheme that is flexible in its input to process individual oscillation frequencies, combinations of them, and average asteroseismic parameters, and derive robust fundamental properties for these targets. Applying this scheme to grids of evolutionary models yields stellar properties with median statistical uncertainties of 1.2 per cent (radius), 1.7 per cent (density), 3.3 per cent (mass), 4.4 per cent (distance), and 14 per cent (age), making this the exoplanet host-star sample with the most precise and uniformly determined fundamental parameters to date. We assess the systematics from changes in the solar abundances and mixing-length parameter, showing that they are smaller than the statistical errors. We also determine the stellar properties with three other fitting algorithms and explore the systematics arising from using different evolution and pulsation codes, resulting in 1 per cent in density and radius, and 2 per cent and 7 per cent in mass and age, respectively. We confirm previous findings of the initial helium abundance being a source of systematics comparable to our statistical uncertainties, and discuss future prospects for constraining this parameter by combining asteroseismology and data from space missions. Finally, we compare our derived properties with those obtained using the global average asteroseismic observables along with effective temperature and metallicity, finding excellent level of agreement. Owing to selection effects, our results show that the majority of the high signal-to-noise ratio asteroseismic Kepler host stars are older than the Sun.},

Comparisons among the different results reveal a good level of agreement

Gaia parallaxes, and binary evolution, finding excellent agreement in
all cases and further confirming the robustness of asteroseismically
determined physical parameters of stars when individual frequencies of

problem to standard cotrending methods. Variable stars are often of
particular astrophysical interest, so the preservation of their signals
is of significant importance to the astrophysical community. We present
a Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach, where a subset of highly
correlated and quiet stars is used to generate a cotrending basis vector
set, which is in turn used to establish a range of
``reasonable'' robust fit parameters. These robust fit
parameters are then used to generate a Bayesian prior and a Bayesian
posterior probability distribution function (PDF) which, when maximized,
finds the best fit that simultaneously removes systematic effects while
reducing the signal distortion and noise injection that commonly
afflicts simple least-squares (LS) fitting. A numerical and empirical
approach is taken where the Bayesian prior PDFs are generated from fits

My emphasis is on low-mass stars because they are present from all epochs of star formation in the Galaxy and because they present both special opportunities and problems. The ages of open clusters are important for understanding the limitations of stellar models and for calibrating empirical age indicators. For individual stars, a hierarchy of quality for the available age-dating methods is described.

The direction-dependent sound speeds and the scaling of fluctuations are consistent with the predictions of field theories of flocking, but sound damping rates show departures from such theories.

is the task of the Presearch Data Conditioning (PDC) module of the

not meet the extremely high performance requirements for the detection
of miniscule planet transits or highly accurate analysis of stellar

In this article we introduce the completely new and significantly

This new PDC version, which utilizes a Bayesian approach for removal of
systematics, reliably corrects errors in the light curves while at the
same time preserving planet transits and other astrophysically
interesting signals. We describe the architecture and the algorithms of
this new PDC module, show typical errors encountered in Kepler data, and

abundance, initial metallicity, mixing length (assumed to be constant
over time), and the age to which the star must be evolved. Some of these
parameters are also very useful in characterizing the associated planets
and in studying Galactic archaeology. How to obtain these parameters
from observations rapidly and accurately, specifically in the context of
surveys of thousands of stars, is an outstanding question, one that has
eluded straightforward resolution. For a given star, we typically
measure the effective temperature and surface metallicity
spectroscopically and low-degree oscillation frequencies through space
observatories. Here we demonstrate that statistical learning, using
artificial neural networks, is successful in determining the
evolutionary parameters based on spectroscopic and seismic measurements.
Our trained networks show robustness over a broad range of parameter
space, and critically, are entirely computationally inexpensive and
fully automated. We analyse the observations of a few stars using this

The surface heavy element abundances of the solar-type stars are reasonably well determined using conventional spectroscopy; however, the second most abundant element helium is not. This is due to the fact that the envelope temperature of such stars is not high enough to excite helium. Since the helium abundance of a star affects its structure and
subsequent evolution, the uncertainty in the helium abundance of a star makes estimates of its global properties (mass, radius, age etc.) uncertain as well. The detections of the signatures of the acoustic glitches from the precisely measured stellar oscillation frequencies provide an indirect way to estimate the envelope helium content. We use the glitch signature caused by the ionization of helium to determine the envelope helium abundance of 38 stars in the Kepler seismic LEGACY sample. Our results confirm that atomic diffusion does indeed take place in solar-type stars. We use the measured surface abundances in
combination with the settling predicted by the stellar models to determine the initial abundances. The initial helium and metal mass fractions have subsequently been used to get the preliminary estimates of the primordial helium abundance, Yp = 0.244 {$\pm$}

  abstract = {Context. The space-borne missions CoRoT and Kepler have provided a large amount of precise photometric data. Among the stars observed, red giants show a rich oscillation pattern that allows their precise characterization. Long-duration observations allow for investigating the fine structure of this oscillation pattern Aims. A common pattern of oscillation frequency was observed in red giant stars, which corresponds to the second-order development of the asymptotic theory. This pattern, called the universal red giant oscillation pattern, describes the frequencies of stellar acoustic modes. We aim to investigate the deviations observed from this universal pattern, thereby characterizing them in terms of the location of the second ionization zone of helium. We also show how this seismic signature depends on stellar evolution.},

  abstract = {With the success of the Kepler and CoRoT missions, the number of stars with detected solar-like oscillations has increased by several orders of magnitude; for the first time we are able to perform large-scale ensemble asteroseismology of these stars. In preparation for this golden age of asteroseismology we have computed expected values of various asteroseismic observables from models of varying mass and metallicity. The relationships between these asteroseismic observables, such as the separations between mode frequencies, are able to significantly
constrain estimates of the ages and masses of these stars. We
investigate the scaling relation between the large frequency separation, {$\Delta\nu$}, and mean stellar density. Furthermore we present model
evolutionary tracks for several asteroseismic diagrams. We have extended the so-called C-D diagram beyond the main sequence to the subgiants and the red giant branch. We also consider another asteroseismic diagram, the epsilon diagram, which is more sensitive to variations in stellar properties at the subgiant stages and can aid in determining the correct mode identification. The recent discovery of gravity-mode period spacings in red giants forms the basis for a third asteroseismic diagram. We compare the evolutionary model tracks in these asteroseismic diagrams with results from pre-Kepler studies of solar-like oscillations and early results from Kepler.},

Data Release 2 parallaxes using asteroseismic data of evolved stars in

the APOKASC-2 catalog, we identify a Gaia astrometric pseudocolor (\{{$\nu$}

- 12.2) {$\mu$}as, in the sense that Gaia parallaxes are too small.
The offset is found in high- and low-extinction samples, as well as
among both shell H-burning red giant stars and core He-burning red clump
stars. We show that errors in the asteroseismic radius and temperature
scales may be distinguished from errors in the Gaia parallax scale. We
estimate systematic effects on the inferred global Gaia parallax offset,
c, due to radius and temperature systematics, as well as choices in
bolometric correction and the adopted form for Gaia parallax spatial
correlations. Because of possible spatially correlated parallax errors,
as discussed by the Gaia team, our Gaia parallax offset model is
specific to the Kepler field, but broadly compatible with the magnitude-
and color-dependent offset inferred by the Gaia team and several
subsequent investigations using independent methods.},

Systematics due to temperature, bolometric correction, extinction, asteroseismic radius, and the spatially correlated Gaia parallax zero-point contribute to a 2\% systematic uncertainty on the agreement in Gaia\textendash asteroseismic
radius. We find that dwarf and giant scaling radii are on a parallactic scale at the level of -2.1\% {$\pm$} 0.5\% (rand.) {$\pm$} 2.0\%
(syst.) (dwarfs) and +1.7\% {$\pm$} 0.3\% (rand.) {$\pm$} 2.0\% (syst.)
(giants), supporting the accuracy and precision of scaling relations. In total, the 2\% agreement that we find holds for stars spanning radii between 0.8 \{R\}{\.o} and 30 \{R\}{\.o} . We do,
however, see evidence for relative errors in scaling radii between dwarfs and giants at the level of 4\% {$\pm$} 0.6\%, and find evidence of departures from simple scaling relations for radii above 30
\{R\}{\.o} . Asteroseismic masses for very metal-poor stars are still overestimated relative to astrophysical priors, but at a reduced level. We see no trend with metallicity in radius agreement for stars with -0.5 {$<$} [Fe/H] {$<$} +0.5. We quantify the spatially
correlated parallax errors in the Kepler field, which globally agree with the Gaia team's published covariance model. We provide Gaia radii, corrected for extinction and the Gaia parallax zero-point, for our full sample of {$\sim$}3900 stars, including dwarfs, subgiants, and first-ascent giants.},
