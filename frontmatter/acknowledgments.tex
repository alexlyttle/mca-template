Thank you to my primary supervisor, Dr Guy Davies, for his support during the the first year of my PhD. Many thanks to my co-supervisor, Dr Andrea Miglio, for his additional comments and support. I would also like to thank Dr Warrick Ball for providing open-source code and Dr Tanda Li for computing stellar models, both used for Figures in this work.
