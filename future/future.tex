\chapter{Future Work}\label{ch:future}

I have demonstrated in Chapter \ref{ch:paper} that our method works on a sample of previously studied stars, returning high-precision stellar parameters in-line with prior work \citep{Serenelli.Johnson.ea2017}. In this chapter, I will briefly discuss future extensions to the method.

\section{Including the Helium II Glitch}

\section{Increasing the Sample Size}

\section{Higher Masses and Evolved Stars}

Our next step is to include intermediate-mass stars with masses from approx. 1.2 solar masses to 3.0 solar masses.
